### What's New?

What new is a simple & efficient news application built in React. It fetches recent news stories via the [News API](https://newsapi.org/), and serves up news in entertainment, health, technology, and science. Users can also search by topic, or view location-based news, made possible via the [Mapquest API](https://developer.mapquest.com/).
